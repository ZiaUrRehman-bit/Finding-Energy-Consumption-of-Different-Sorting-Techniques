    "<font style=\"color:rgb(255,255,255)\">The Karatsuba algorithm is a fast multiplication algorithm that was developed by Anatoly Karatsuba in the 1960s. It is a divide and conquer algorithm that reduces the multiplication of two n-digit numbers to three multiplications of n/2-digit numbers. It is based on the observation that the product of two numbers can be expressed as the sum of two products of half the size, plus a correction term.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Karatsuba algorithm has a time complexity of *`O(n^log_2 3)`*, which is faster than the traditional multiplication algorithm, which has a time complexity of **```O(n^2)```**. This makes it more efficient for large numbers and has made it a popular choice for implementing multiplication in computer software. It is also used as a building block for more efficient multiplication algorithms, such as the **```Toom-Cook```** algorithm and the **```Sch√∂nhage-Strassen```** algorithm. </font>"
